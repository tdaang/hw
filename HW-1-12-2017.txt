Absolute vs relative paths:
Amanda should be able to use the following to navigate to her home directory (Users/amanda/data to Users/amanda):
	cd ~
	cd ~/data/..
	cd
	cd ..

Relative Path resolution:
ls ../backup would display:
	original pnas_final pnas_sub

ls Reading Comprehension:
In order to display pnas_sub pnas_final original you could use:
	either ls -r -F or ls -r -F /User/backup but not ls pwd

Exploring More ls Arguments:
The command ls with -l and -h would:
	-l: show in a long listing format, including the file size and modification times
	-h: makes it human readable, shows the final size in kb, mb etc

Listing Recursively and by Time:
The command ls -R -t would:
	list the directories alphabetically, but within each directory, the files and directories would be listed by the time of last change
